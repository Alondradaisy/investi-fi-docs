# INVESTI-FI UI CASE STUDY

## A breakdown of my ideation to creation process for a Fin-Tech iOS asset management concept app.

Fin-tech, short for financial technology, has seen a significant increase in user engagement for products and services that have developed mobile based solutions. Insider Intelligence released a brief highlight story that covered projections for crypto's direction claiming, "Crypto companies are offering high-yield products that behave like depository bank accounts." The more we as users regularly engage with our devices to access the accounts previously only accessible in-person, the more offerings will roll out to serve consumer needs digitally. 

What inspired me to conceptualize a financial management app was the excitement that I have for the future of fin-tech itself. We're dipping our toes into the waters of revolutionary accessibility, control and security of assets. I anticipate discovering the major advancements as they continue rolling out. For now, I'll conceptualize aesthetics and functionalities.
